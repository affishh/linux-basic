How do you create a user account?
sol: To create a user account in Linux, you typically use the useradd or adduser command from the terminal.
Using adduser command - adduser username
Username can be replaced with desired new username.
The adduser command will prompt us to set up a password for the given username and filling up the additional details such as full name, room number, work phone etc, which can be skipped by pressing enter.

We can also use useradd command as follows:
useradd username
However it does not creates a home directory(home/username) and does not set a default shell or whatever is in /etc/default/useradd also does not set a password, the user cant log in until you run
Alternatively we can use - useradd -m -s /bin/bash username
where -m creates home directory(/home/username) and bash as their shell

Example:-
afrin@LAPTOP-DILC0HD8:~$ sudo adduser test1
info: Adding user `test1' ...
info: Selecting UID/GID from range 1000 to 59999 ...
info: Adding new group `test1' (1001) ...
info: Adding new user `test1' (1001) with group `test1 (1001)' ...
info: Creating home directory `/home/test1' ...
info: Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for test1
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: test
        Room Number []:
        Work Phone []:
        Home Phone []:
        Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y
info: Adding new user `test1' to supplemental / extra groups `users' ...
info: Adding user `test1' to group `users' ...
